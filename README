A DEVELOPMENT NOTE:
===================

Developing the reproducible builds environment for Tor Browser with
gitian/tor-browser-bundle is deprecated. Recently, we switched to
rbm/tor-browser-build. See:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/23213. To get started with the
new system, check out
https://git.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git and follow the
instructions in the README file.

-------------------

There are currently two ways to use the Tor Browser Bundle builder.

If you are already on an Ubuntu 12.04+ machine or VM, please see
./gitian/README.build.

Otherwise, see ./vagrant/README.md.
