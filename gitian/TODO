Short Term:
 - Fix localization bugs
 - Fix windows issues:
   - Link to DirectX via Wine (for WebGL)
   - Enable accessibility (needs WIDL and other patches)

     - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=803084
 - Source integrity
   - Validate mirror sources during prep stage
   - Store all required gpg keys in repo
     - Add them during check-prerequisites
   - Pull more things from git repos
     - HTTPS-Everywhere
 - Hardening options
   - http://wiki.debian.org/Hardening
   - Can we randomize stack canaries each release, etc?

Mid Term:
 - MacOS cross compilation?
   - http://www.tarnyko.net/en/?q=node/9
   - https://launchpad.net/~flosoft/+archive/cross-apple/+packages
   - http://wiki.freepascal.org/Cross_compiling_OSX_on_Linux
 - Compile the toolchain, too?
   - Doing so might allow us to build deterministically
     using other Linux distributions as our base image
     - Defense in depth against distribution-wide compromise
     - Though we may still have issues with linking against
       OS shared libraries if the versions don't match.
       - Build them too? Or is it safe to ship reference link
         stubs?
 - FIPS-140?
